//express js
it has http method is a callback function
get and res.send
all has 2 paras "*" req, res / res.status.send()

//how to send file 
We need a path then path.resolve("__dirname,"")

//static is the file that server doen't have to change
app.use(express.static("name of folder"));

//params

//middleware
is the functions or programs which runs when the sever gets request and send response

app.use() will invoke in every route. It always has to put on the top. it can apply the route which will apply to all of the route.

We can pass more than one middleware pass it as []
we can use middleware from express app.use(express.static)
or we can use the third party morgan

//http method 
GET is for reading file

POST is for insert file
in JS is different
We need to parse json app.use(express.json())

PUT
for get one specific item

//Postman
can help check the route right always

//express router
router = express.Router();
to use router we need to export the file and set app.use("route name", "name's file") **don't forget the set app.use(express.json()) so we cannot use req.body

//express controller
we create the function that control the route export as the object and destructure in other file.
